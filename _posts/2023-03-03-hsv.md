HSV model depends upon the human perception, and if you don't know what it is, we can start from RGB model. 

The left figure shows a RGB cube. If we look at this cube from the white vertex to black vertex angle, we get a Hexagon in which all the six colors(3 RGB colour + 3 CMY[[Why do printers use the CMY color model instead of RGB?::rmn-transclude]] color) from that cube's vertex have different angles, and they are seperated each by 60 degrees. We can also twist the hexagon a bit to get a RGB-CMY hue circle. This is what we always saw as the pure colour top layer of a HSV cone.

Note: just to clarify
