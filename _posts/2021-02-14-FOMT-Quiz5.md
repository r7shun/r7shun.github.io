11. At the end of this week's lecture, John played the Bach 'Prelude in C' (BWV 846). Why do those B-flats at the end not take us away from the key of C major, i.e. why are they not part of a modulation to F major?

    Choose which of the following help to explain this.

    - Because there is no perfect cadence in the key of F
    - Because of the C bass note running all the way through these last bars.
