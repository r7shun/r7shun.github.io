Our ability to use the thumb against the four fingers is what distinguishes us
from the lower primates, who just do not get the right-hand rule. There are
cave drawings of motors and generators that were doomed to failure since
those cave dwellers were curving all five fingers. Then the right-hand rule
was invented. It is an invention that matches the wheel and fire in significance
and after that there was no stopping us.[[Just to be fun.. Don't take it serious::rmn]]
