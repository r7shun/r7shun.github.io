> I am not here to tell you what to do. I'm here to assist you whenever you need me.
> you must find what triggers your passion and makes you believe in your own work
> that's the key component of doing a phd
> if you didn't give a good thinking and just pick up whatever is feasible to you
> you won't have the energy to make other people believe in your work
> because you don't even believe in your own work
> people can always tell and they won't value your voices or ideas if they don't see it in you
> so no matter how long it takes, you have to find it
> that's why most PHDs usually take so long
