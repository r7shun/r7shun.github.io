##### wing structures

> \\( ws^b / ws^+ \\)

- wild type: straight
- mutant: Curly-Winged Flies (bent?), They have a defect in their "curly gene," which is on the [[second chromosome::highlight]]. Having curled wings is a [[dominant::highlight]] mutation, which means that only one copy of the gene has to be altered to produce the defect. In fact, if both copies are mutated, the flies [[do not survive::highlight]]. 

##### body color

> \\( bc^d / bd^+ \\)

- wild type: light brown
- mutant: Ebony Flies, They carry a [[defect::highlight]] in their "ebony gene," on the [[third::highlight]] chromosome. Normally, the ebony gene is responsible for building up the tan-colored pigments in the normal fruit fly. If the ebony gene is defective, the black pigments accumulate all over the body. Ebony is recessiveEbony is [[recessive::highlight]]. (dark brown?)

##### eye color

> \\( ec^w / ec^+ \\)

- wild type: apple red
- mutant: white,  Like the orange-eyed flies, they also have a defect in their "white" gene. But in these flies, the white gene is totally defective: it produces no red pigment at all. The eye color gene is located on the [[X chromosome::highlight]]. White eye color is [[recessive::highlight]].


##### eye shape

> \\( es^d / es^+ \\)

- wild type: round eyes
- mutant: Bar eye is [[X-linked and dominant::highlight]](drop-shaped?)
