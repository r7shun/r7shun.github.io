# Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Episode 12 

{:.serif .oblique}
What I told her, shattered her world. Her lifelong search led to stories of murder, and now it's too difficult to continue. Her search is over, her story ends here. But you know what she said?

 [[这么多年，她以为自己遭人嫌弃，孤苦漂泊。每一个收留她的家庭都希望她快走，也不关心她。但原来是神盾局在一直保护她，照顾她。这才是她听进心里去的部分 —— 不是她永远也找不到的亲生家人，而是这个一直伴她左右的大家庭。我告诉了她一件足以让她觉得万籁俱灰的事，但不知怎么，她却让我的伤痛有所减轻。这世间充满了邪恶、谎言、痛苦和死亡，对此你无处可逃，你只能面对。关键在于，当面对这些时，你会怎么做，你会成为什么样的人。::rmn]]

[[Agent May::lsn]] Tell me. 

{:.serif .oblique}
[[Agent Coulson::lsn]] She said no -- her story started here. Her whole life, she thought she wasn't wanted, that she didn't belong, that every family that took her in didn't want her to stay, didn't care. But all that time, it was S.H.I.E.L.D. protecting her, looking after her. That's what she took away from the story -- [[not the family she'll never have but the one she's always had::highlight]]. Here I am, telling her somthing that could [[destroy her faith in humanity::highlight]]. And some how she managed to repair a little piece of mine. The world is [[full of evil and lies and pain and death, and you can't hide from it -- you can only face it.::highlight]] The question is, when you do, how do you repond? Who do you become?

[[It's a bit ironic. Watched roughly half season and gradually fell in love with S.H.I.E.L.D., but later only to find that it had been infiltrated into a sieve by Hydra and collapsed suddenly...::wrap]]

# Call me by your name

**The dad’s monologue**

{:.serif .oblique}
When you least expect it, nature has cunning ways of finding our weakest spot. Just remember I’m here. Right now, you may not want to feel anything. Maybe you’ll never want to feel anything. And, maybe it’s not to me you want to speak about these things, but I feel something you obviously did. 

[[在最措手不及的时刻，自然总是狡猾地找到我们的致命软肋，但记住，我在。现在你或许想斩断一切情愫，再也不想有任何瓜葛，也许你不想和我聊这些，不过，坦然接受曾经的情感吧，你们有过一段美好的友谊，或许超过了友谊，我羡慕你。我想，多数父母只会希望这种事情烟消云散，祈祷孩子能恢复正常，可我不是这种家长。为了所谓的尽快痊愈，我们压抑了自己太多天性，以致年岁未及而立心却早已枯竭。每当踏入新的感情，能付出的情意就越发淡薄，但若只为麻痹自己不为情所困，何其浪费。我是不是说的太多了，那我就再多说点，你就明白了。我有过类似的感触，却从没体会过你们这样的感情，总有些事让我犹豫，或是阻碍着我。如何生活取决于你，只要记住，我们的内心和身体，都是无二的赏赐，而不经意间，你的心便已枯竭。至于身体，总有一天，会再无悦者，更别说有肌肤之触。此时此刻的悲伤和痛苦，不要扼杀掉，与痛携手而来的，是你经历的快乐。::rmn]]

Look, you had a beautiful friendship. Maybe more than a friendship. And I envy you.

{:.serif .oblique}
In my place, most parents would hope the whole thing goes away, or pray that their sons land on their feet. But I am not such a parent. We rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster that we go bankrupt by the age of 30 and have less to offer each time we start with someone new. But to make yourself feel nothing so as not to feel anything—what a waste!

{:.serif .oblique}
Have I spoken out of turn? And I’ll say one more thing… it’ll clear the air. I may have come close, but I never have what you two have. Something always held me back or stood in the way. How you live your life is your business. Just remember, our hearts and our bodies are given to us only once, and before you know it, your heart’s worn out. And as for your body, there comes a point when no one looks at it, much less wants to come near it. Right now, there’s sorrow, pain; don’t kill it, and with it, the joy you’ve felt.

# Good Will Hunting


Sean——So, if I asked you about art, you'd probably give me the skinny on Every art book ever written.

肖恩：如果我问你艺术,你可能会提出艺术书籍中的粗浅论调。

Michelangelo. You know a lot about him: life's work, political aspirations, him and the Pope, sexual orientation, the whole works, right?

有关米开朗基罗,你知道很多，他的满腔政治热情，与教皇相交莫逆，耽于性爱，你对他很清楚吧？

But I bet you can't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. You've never actually stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling…seeing that.

但你连西斯汀教堂的气味也不曾嗅到？你未曾站在那儿，昂首眺望天花板上的名画吧？可是我见过。

If I ask you about women, you'll probably give me a syllabus of your personal favorites. You may have even been laid a few times. But you can't tell me what it feels like to wake up next to a woman and feel truly happy.

如果我问关于女人的事， 你大可以向我如数家珍，你可能上过几次床，但你没法说出当自己在女人身旁醒来时，那份涌自内心真正的喜悦。

You're a tough kid. And I ask you about war, you'd probably, uh, throw Shakespeare at me, right? "Once more onto the breach, dear friends…"

你年轻彪悍，我如果和你谈论战争，你会向我大抛莎士比亚， 朗诵“共赴战场，亲爱的朋友”

But you've never been near one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap…and watched him gasp his last breath, lookin' to you for help.

但你从未亲临战阵，未试过把挚友的头拥入怀里，看着他吸着最后一口气，凝望着你，垂死向你求助。

I ask you about love, you'll probably quote me a sonnet. But you've never looked at a woman and been totally vulnerable……

我问你何为爱情，你可能只会吟风弄月，但你未试过全情投入真心倾倒，

Known someone that could level you with her eyes……feelin' like God put an angel on earth just for you……who could rescue you from the depths of hell……

四目交投时彼此了解对方的心，好比上帝安排天使下凡只献给你，把你从地狱深渊拯救出来

And you wouldn't know what it's like to be her angel……to have that love for her, be there forever…through anything…through cancer.

对她百般关怀的感受你也从未体会，你从未对她情深款款矢志厮守，明知她患了绝症也再所不惜，你从未尝试过痛失挚爱的感受。

And you wouldn't know about sleeping sittin' up in a hospital room for two months, holding her hand, because the doctors could see in your eyes that the terms "visiting hours" don't apply to you.

你也从未经历过在她的病床前坚定不移地陪伴，紧握着她的纤手，因为医生知道你根本就不在乎“探访时间”的明文约束。

You don't know about real loss……'cause that only occurs when you love something more than you love yourself. I doubt you've ever dared to love anybody that much.

你并没有体会过“失去”的真正意义...因为只有在你爱某人甚于自身时才会领悟。我怀疑你从未付出过这样的爱。

I look at you.I don't see an intelligent, confident man. I see a cocky, scared-shitless kid.

现在我看着你，眼前所见并非一位聪敏、自信的男人，而是一个无耻狂妄、内心恐惧的孩子

But you're a genius, Will. No one denies that. No one could possibly understand the depths of you.

但是你是个天才，威尔。这是毋庸置疑的。没人可以完全认识到你的深度。

But you presume to know everything about me, because you saw a painting of mine. You ripped my fuckin' life apart.

但是你在我的油画上瞥过一眼、就以为了解了我的一切？你的狂言糟蹋了我的人生！

You're an orphan, right? Do you think I know the first thing about how hard your life has been? How you feel? Who you are? Because I read Oliver Twist? Does that encapsulate you?

你是个孤儿吧？但你认为我能看穿你的悲惨生活、认识你的全部，仅仅因为我读过《雾都孤儿》？莫非它能简化你的人生？

Personally, I don't give a shit about all that. Because you know what? I can't learn anything from you I can't read in some fuckin' book.

个人而言，我对此莫不关心。因为你知道吗？我无法通过一些破书来认识你的一点一滴。

Unless, you wanna talk about you…who you are. Then I 'm fasciated. I'm in. But you don't want to do that, do you? You're terrified of what you might say.

除非你先谈论自己，告诉我你到底是谁。于是我对此着迷，我愿意来帮助你。但是你并不想这么做，是吗？你甚至还怕你会被说出来的话吓到。
